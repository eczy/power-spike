IMPROVEMENTS FOR GOLD:
Most of the iteration this week was done on professionalism and game showcase readiness. We experimented with adjustments to battery count, slows, and punching rework,
but it was too risky to use when there is no time to playtest it.

We got a lot of feed back about the tutorial level and we tried to address that feedback this week.
We brought the text boxes into each players individual box.
We brought the boxes closer together to make it easier to see your player.
Added player models to the players select screen.

We completely redid the main menu screen to make it more appropriate for a game showcase environment.
We made it so the start screen loops a cinematic that pans around the main level and players.
Players have a chance to grab a controller and ready up before the game starts, they can also leave or timeout on this screen.

Juice:
Jump animation
Made players more distinguishable because the color scheme last week was pretty similar.
Added bloom to lightning between players.
Added end game animation instead of just an abrupt fade to black.
Added IFrames on player respawn.

We tried to change the score screen to make it easier to identify your player now that we dont have charges anymore.
