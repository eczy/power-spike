IMPROVEMENTS:
=============
- HARD pivot; it's like a whole new game
- Players don't fall through the map anymore!!!
- Symmetric 2v2 game instead of an asymmetric 3v1 game
- 2D instead of 3D
- Player models are back to capsules, but we are actively looking for new character models that aren't Unity primitives
- Viking (kinda) theme -> Electricity/tech theme
- All players now have same abilities; only their "charge" is different which affects only one ability
- Now more of a capture the flag type of game than defend the goal/kill the boss game
- Player selection functionality

IMPROVEMENTS SINCE GAMEJAM (@austin and thomas):
- You can no longer pick up batteries from your own pile
- Trail renderer on red players are now red and not blue
- Red respawner is oriented correctly now
- Music loops on main menu and in fighting level
- You can now play without 4 players being selected (at least one needs to be selected though). Unselected players do not have a controller and do nothing.
